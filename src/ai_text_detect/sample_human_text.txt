My grandmother's apple pie recipe has been in our family for over a century. Every fall, when the apples in her backyard tree ripened, she would spend an entire weekend baking pies for the whole neighborhood.

I can still remember the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg wafting through her small kitchen. She never used measuring cups - everything was done by feel and intuition. A pinch of this, a handful of that. When I asked her for the exact measurements, she would just smile and say "you'll know when it feels right."

The secret, she told me, was in the crust. She would work the butter into the flour with her hands until it resembled coarse breadcrumbs. Then, just a little ice water, mixed in slowly until the dough came together. Never overwork it, she would warn. "Tough crust makes for disappointed guests."

Last weekend, I tried to recreate her recipe for my own children. As I stood in my modern kitchen with all its gadgets and precise measuring tools, I found myself yearning for her simple, intuitive approach. The pie turned out well, but it wasn't quite the same. Maybe the secret ingredient was something that couldn't be measured or replicated - the love and memories baked into every slice.
